 * @class KGame::AudioScene audioscene.h <KGame/AudioScene>
 *
 * This class exposes general properties of the audio playback context. Actual
 * sounds are represented in this context by KGame::Sound instances.
 *
 * The audio scene basically consists of a listener. The position of this
 * listener is relevant when sounds are played at certain positions: The audio
 * channels will then be balanced to make the sound appear to come from that
 * direction.
 *
 * Because there can only be one listener, all methods in this class are static.
 *
 * @warning Not all functionally exposed by the API of this class is guaranteed
 *          to be available on the compiled TagaroAudio backend. If a property
 *          is not supported, the getter will return a sensible default value
 *          and the setter will do nothing except for warning via kDebug().
